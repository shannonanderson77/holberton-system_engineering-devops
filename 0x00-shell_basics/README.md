##This project is about shell basics. The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform as opposed to the terminal which is a program that opens a window used to interact with the shell. The shell opens with a shell prompt, denoted by a $ as the last character before the cursor. In order to delete or overwrite any file on the system you must be superuser denoted by a # as the last character before the cursor at the shell prompt.
