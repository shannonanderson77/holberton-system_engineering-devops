<h1>Readme</h1>

<p>This project is about file permissions. Commands chmod, sudo, su, chown, chgrp, id, groups, whoami, adduser, useradd and addgroup are used in Unix-like systems to protect users from each other given the multi-user capability of the system. This system prevents the actions of one user from crashing the system and/or interfering with the files of another user.</p>

<p>On a Linux system permission rights are assigned for reading, writing and executing a file. Each user (owner, members of a group of users and everybody else) is assigned access rights for each file and directory.</p>
