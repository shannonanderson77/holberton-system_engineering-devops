Readme

This project is about file permissions. Commands chmod, sudo, su, chown, chgrp, id, groups, whoami, adduser, useradd and addgroup are used in Unix-like systems to protect users from each other given the multi-user capability of the system. This system prevents the actions of one user from crashing the system and/or interfering with the files of another user.

On a Linux system permission rights are assigned for reading, writing and executing a file. Each user (owner, members of a group of users and everybody else) is assigned access rights for each file and directory.

Commands:

sudo - execute a command as another user
chown - change the file owner and group
chgrg - change group ownership
chmod - change file mode bits
id - print real and effective user and group IDs
group - print the group a user is in
whoami - print effective userid
adduser - add a user to the system
addgroup - add a group to the system
useradd - create a new user or update default new user information
